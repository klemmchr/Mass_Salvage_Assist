**A NOTE ON DISTRIBUTION OF THIS ADDON, AND MY LEGAL LICENSING**

I Added a License to this as I was approached by an entity who wanted to incorporate it into a paid addon that exists out there (I will refrain from naming). I have no plans to ever allow distribution of this wrapped within a paid addon. I appreciate they at least asked. All rights reserved to myself, the addon developer and sole creator, and I will keep it freely open to all, though I retain the rights of distribution through the channels I see fit as an open source and free addon. If you wish to incorporate some aspects of this into your FREE and openly available addon, I am a pretty fair-minded individual who tends to lean towards supporting things that are of a greater benefit for us all, hence why I even released this addon publicly and did not quietly keep this to myself for an economic advantage within the game. But, I do wish to be contacted regarding so. In addition, If there are  features you would wish to add to this, I am more than happy to consider any pull requests on GitHub. You can find the Github page here: [https://github.com/TheGeneticsGuy/Mass_Salvage_Assist](https://github.com/TheGeneticsGuy/Mass_Salvage_Assist). Thank you for listening, and hopefully for your understanding!

***QUALITY OF LIFE and BUG FIXES***

*I spent an immense amount of time just trying to break crafting here, and I found a number of ways to do it. For example, let's say you are crafting, but then you decide to wander your professions recipes. Well, before, this could interrupt your restacking because you were no longer focused on the right recipe page. This will now take that into account by using. There were probably about half a dozen other ways I found you could erroneously break the nonstop crafting, restacking, and refreshing of the creal all count and I adapted all of them so they will not be an issue. In other words, the addon won't be as sensitive to craft interruption through just normal user behavior. I probably didn't find all of them, but it's a start.*

* No matter the profession, if it's a salvage spell, it will be compatible. Universal compatibility has now been built into this.

* Fixed an issue where the checkbox on the timer for only calculating based on items in bags would disappear and reapper whilst you were parousing your profession recipes. Now, if you are already crafting that checkbox will be locked in so you can toggle on and off at will, even if looking at a different recipe.

* Fixed an issue where the timer button was disappearing behind the profession window when clicking the window. It was really just that the professions window was coming to the front. I adjusted the timer to ensure it shared the same strata and thus would remaing at level with it.

* Fixed an issue where with the slash command sometimes stacks would sometimes fail to stack enough if there were multiple sub-minimum craft size stacks ... tightend up the timings a little bit as well on the stacking.

**NOTE ON THE TIMER AND HOW IT WORKS**

Determining the exact estimated countdown is not a perfect thing since there is no way to query the server for the time it takes to craft each time. In addition, lag either from a crowded server, or from your own end can effect the time it takes to craft. So, the key word is this is an estimate only. Here's the logic of how it works:

* The "calculating" delay initially requires 10 crafts to occur. The time between each craft is collected and then the average of those 10 crafts is used to determine time per craft.

* The countdown is refreshed on occasion where a new collection of timestamps is collected and a new average is made. This is done inconspicuously, as to not be obvious, but it will explain to you why say, the countdown timer initially said 7 minutes, but total crafting time end up being 7 minutes and 20 seconds. The timing gets a little tighter the more you craft.


## **Mass Salvage Assist - Version 1.0.6 - Nov 5th, 2024

* The timer window should now only appear automatically when doing a "create all" not just single item crafts

* The timer button has been moved to not be in the way of other addons. It is now located in the top right corner. Added a tooltip as well with additional info.

* You can now type `/msa reset` to reset the position of the timer window to default, in case you accidentally drag it off screen somehow.

* The addon should now properly load no matter what other addons have been installed. There was an issue where craftsim was pre-loading some frames so some of the trogger event listeners I was using were not firing off because they had already been loaded prior to this addon even being loaded.

## **Mass Salvage Assist - Version 1.0.5 - Nov 3rd, 2024

***NEW FEATURE - CRAFTING TIMER***

* This works with ALL profession crafting, not just salvaging recipes.
* In the case of salvaging recipes, an additional option will be included to only calculate the time remaining based on just reagents in bags.
* A button has been added to the professions window to open/close the crafting window, but it will also auto-open on start, and close on finish
* You can also `/msa timer` to show/hide the timer window.

***QUALITY OF LIFE IMPROVEMENTS***

* When using the slash command/macro to craft, if nonstop salvaging is currently disabled, it will now inform you.

* You can now `/msa enable` or `/msa disable` to turn on and off the nonstop salvaging.

* All skinning refine spells have been added to the nonstop crafting.

* Enchanting Recipe *Shatter Essence* is now fully supported

***BUG FIXES***

* Fixed a bug where the addon would cause Lua errors when doing other various tasks in the game if you have not yet opened the professions window. This is because it was on-demand loading certain frames

* Fixed an issue when crafting with macros it sometimes would be point to the wrong bag slot item to salvage and interrupt crafting.


## **Mass Salvage Assist - Version 1.0.4 - Oct 31st, 2024

*I was unaware of the memory leak issue on Blizz's end where when crafting the addon memory usage can go through the roof. While it still does proper garbage collection, it still consumes massive amounts of memory when using professions. This isn't a huge deal, except if you are on a PC where Frames start to slow down, and it gets choppy, this can actually end up interrupting nonstop crafting. So, I was informed by a few people that there is actually this workaround people developed to bypass this memory issue by way of using macros. You can start salvaging with a macro rather than ever opening the player window. I have decided to implement this type of adaptation support to this addon as well.*

* Code tweaked slightly that will help some memory performance with the professions window, but it doesn't resolve the main issue with professions.

* Mass Salvage Assist(MSA) will now full support salvaging nonstop even without the profession window open.

**SALVAGING WITHOUT PROFESSION WINDOW OPEN**

* Slash command has been added to the addon `/msa`

    - Example - Mass Mill Hochenblume:
    - `/msa craft recipe_id item_id`
    - `/msa craft 382981 191461`
    -
    - You can also get help:
    - `/msa help`

    - YES, this can be used within a macro.
